    <p style="margin-left: 10em">The collaborators have gathered some pieces of data that focus on the sanctions of water, sanitation, and hygiene. Statistics will help enrich our knowledge about the concept by acknowledging and analyzing several interpretations patterns, and results. Moreover, these data sets have been conducted recently as of late 2024 in different countries and regions worldwide. Feel free to check on the given presentations. If you ever have any further clarifications, reviews, or any type of reaction, you can check on our socials labeled on the help page. Let us now move on to the presentations starting with how diarrhea affects numerous children due to unsafe drinking of water.</p>
    <p class="quote" style="margin-left: 15em">Note: All information is credited and supported by sources while references are cited in our about us page.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 10em">The UNICEF organization (2024) mentions that contaminated drinking water, poor sanitation, and hygiene-related diseases cause millions of deaths annually, particularly among young children. These diseases cause malnutrition and stunting. An example could be how a digestive illness diarrhea can produce 300,000 deaths annually from this alone. Despite advancements, 2.2 billion people worldwide lack access to safe drinking water systems and 4.2 billion people lack access to well-run sanitation systems. The next set of discussions is illustrated with the aid of visuals. For the next ones, these data sets will vary depending on your location. In your case, it shall feature the <mark style="background-color: #c1b3fc;">Philippines</mark>.</p>

	<p style="margin-left: 10em; clear: left"><br>The country's export of household cleaning products skyrocketed as soon as 2019 and 2020 occurred. In fact, the HHI trend reached to monopoly level signifying how cleaning materials had influence and domination over exporting countries such as the US, Japan, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Australia, and more. A possible reason that suggests how the trends increased is the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic gave the floor for more cleaning agents and protective methods to become demands for communities and nations worldwide, according to Mich Phason, a scientist which the collaborators interviewed as well.</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10em; clear: left"><br>Moving on to the local side of things, Sitchon (2023) reported that the Metropolitan Cebu Water District or MCWD noted that there were 8,974 cases of pipe leakages in numerous service locations in the province back in 2022. This caused a major disaster for the city and its settlers. By the next year, the original 60% to 70% of activity leaks approached to 100%. Cebu is now on its way to fixing this concern so that it will not cause further problems in the near future. This adds to how we must regularly and thoroughly check our plumbing systems to prevent such issues. In conclusion, we shall utilize these methods to take care of our water supply that supports the entire world.<br><br></p>
