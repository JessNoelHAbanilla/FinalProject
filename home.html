    <p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), safety is beneficial, particularly in the fields of sanitation and drinking water. Clean water prevents the spread of multiple diseases such as dengue, diarrhea, cholera, and other bacterial infections. Furthermore, it protects communities from pollution and environmental disasters like floods, leakages, etc.</p>
    <p class="quote">“I can’t see a world where people had to live with polluted water and consider the consequences. This endless suffering shouldn't exist!” <br>- Ruuki Satozaki, doctor and healthcare manager</p>

	<p>As the collaborators conducted mandatory interviews, hygiene specialist and urban planning developer Thomas Myers stated that safe and drinkable water is a demand for nations worldwide. “I have always heard a lot of complaints about what goes outside their faucet every day which is why I put on the extra work in promoting clear plumbing systems”, he said. There are even tips that he mentioned in his interview.</p>
	<ul>
	    <li>* Check out damaged pipes and repair them immediately.</li>
		<li>* Determine the water quality regularly. Make sure that it is drinkable for all ages.</li>
		<li>* Know where the water comes from and how it travels directly.</li>
		<li>* And last but not least, record and define how the water is used.</li>
    </ul>
	<p style="clear: left; margin: 7em">These 4 statements are important according to him because they provide clear examples of how clean water and sanitation are manageable. And so, it is highly encouraged to participate in regular hygiene. It is not yet the end of the world where we can engage with keeping the environment safe from as much as we can!
