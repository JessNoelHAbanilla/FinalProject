		<p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), safety is beneficial, particularly in the fields of sanitation and drinking water. Clean water prevents the spread of multiple diseases such as dengue, diarrhea, cholera, and other bacterial infections. Furthermore, it protects communities from pollution and environmental disasters like floods, leakages, etc.</p>

		<p style="margin-left: 14em">As the collaborators conducted mandatory interviews, hygiene specialist and urban planning developer Thomas Myers stated that safe and drinkable water is a demand for nations worldwide. “I have always heard a lot of complaints about what goes outside their faucet every day which is why I put on the extra work in promoting clear plumbing systems”, he said. There are even tips that he mentioned in his interview.</p>
